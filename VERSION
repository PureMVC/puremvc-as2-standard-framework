1.0 - Updated by Pedr - Equivalent with AS3 2.0.3. 
			IMPORTANT - There has been a major change specific to this port involving 
			Commands. You now pass class references into registerCommand() instead of
			instances. (Thanks to James Tann). This will break previous implememtations
			but brings this port almost completely into line with the AS3 version - all
			other differences are small and mainly internal.
			As with AS3, notifyObservers() is back on IFacade. The following internal 
			chnages have also been made  :

			From As3 2.0.2 version notes :
			Refactored View.removeMediator method, moving the logic for removing
      an observer into a removeObserver method (also on IView), which is now 
      called by the Controller.removeCommand method as well as the
      View.removeMediator method. This fixes the issue described here:
      http://forums.puremvc.org/index.php?topic=308.0 
      Also, the Proxy.removeProxy method only attempts to remove the Proxy 
      if it is registered.
			
0.9 - Equivalent with AS3 2.0.1, added onRegister/onRemove to IProxy and
      Proxy. Model calls these at appropriate times. And MVC actors moved
      to core folder so they can share internals for an upcoming fix. -CLH

0.8 - Updated by Pedr to match AS3 2.0 

      From AS3 relNotes - This release breaks backward compatibility with any 
      previous release...because the Mediator naming scheme changed to match 
      that of the Proxy. Now the constructor to the Mediator takes a 
      mediatorName argument before the viewComponent argument. This means 
      that you no longer need to override the getMediatorName method in 
      your Mediators, you merely send the name to super to be set in the 
      constructor.The Mediator also gets a setViewComponent method so that 
      transient view components are supported. The Model, View and Facade 
      removeProxy and removeMediator methods now return a reference to the 
      Proxy or Mediator that was removed from the Model or the View. This 
      supports dynamic unregistration and reregistration of Proxies and 
      Mediators. And the Facade now implements INotifier, adding a 
      sendNotification method. This method makes use of the facade's 
      notifyObservers method, and so Notifier's sendNotification method now 
      calls facade.sendNotification. This means that you never have
      to create a notification inside the facade and call notifyObservers,
      you may simply call sendNotification with the parameters in the same
      way that Commands, Mediators and Proxies do. It is left public in the
      facade only so that you may still create and send custom notification
      classes. 

0.7  - Updated by Pedr to match AS3 1.7.1

0.6  - Checked in currently working version. Unit tests haven't been 
        converted yet, but it has had quite a bit of exercising and seems
        to work fine. - CLH
