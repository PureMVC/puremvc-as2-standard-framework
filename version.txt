      From AS3 relNotes - This release breaks backward compatibility with any 
      previous release...because the Mediator naming scheme changed to match 
      that of the Proxy. Now the constructor to the Mediator takes a 
      mediatorName argument before the viewComponent argument. This means 
      that you no longer need to override the getMediatorName method in 
      your Mediators, you merely send the name to super to be set in the 
      constructor.The Mediator also gets a setViewComponent method so that 
      transient view components are supported. The Model, View and Facade 
      removeProxy and removeMediator methods now return a reference to the 
      Proxy or Mediator that was removed from the Model or the View. This 
      supports dynamic unregistration and reregistration of Proxies and 
      Mediators. And the Facade now implements INotifier, adding a 
      sendNotification method. This method makes use of the facade's 
      notifyObservers method, and so Notifier's sendNotification method now 
      calls facade.sendNotification. This means that you never have
      to create a notification inside the facade and call notifyObservers,
      you may simply call sendNotification with the parameters in the same
      way that Commands, Mediators and Proxies do. It is left public in the
      facade only so that you may still create and send custom notification
      classes.
