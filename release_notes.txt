Writing PureMVC-based Applications in AS2
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The simple language caveats:

AS3					AS2
-----------------	-----------------
void				Void
const				var
addEventListener	addListener
a = b as MyClass	a = MyClass(b)
protected			public
override			n/a


FlashLite Implementation notes:
-------------------------------

* Don't use fscommand2 in the constructor of a Mediator. 
It will work in the phone but it will transform the object in a very 
strange and unregisterable way inside the Flash 9 player. 

* Events are not the same as in Flash 9. flash.events.Event does not 
exist. Events are far more rudimentary. 

Because the way they are handled is by setting a function onto a 
MovieClip, which will execute in the context of that MovieClip, 
it is difficult for a MovieClip to communicate out-bound to its 
Mediator. 

A Delegate class similar to mx.controls.Delegate is used to add 
the Mediator's methods as the listener methods on a stewarded 
MovieClip, and have those methods called from the context of the
Mediator and not the clip. Arguments can be passed.
